Call to Action,"Construction errors cost the UK industry billions every single year. The annual spend due to error is estimated to be around 7 times the total annual profit of the UK Construction Industry.

The Get It Right Initiative came out of discussions at the Institution of Civil Engineers Best Practice Panel and has been developed with the single aim of significantly reducing error in construction. The Get It Right Initiative is currently led by a number of major construction companies and clients and has received welcome support from the CITB through their Growth and Innovation Fund.

Our first piece of work has been to undertake thorough research to identify both the most economically significant errors and their causes. Our study group involved seventeen major construction organisations including Clients, Consultants, Contractors and their supply chains.

Construction errors cost the UK industry billions every single year. The annual spend due to error is estimated to be around 7 times the total annual profit of the UK Construction Industry.
<div class=""entry-content"">

When unrecorded process waste, latent defects and indirect costs are included, the situation gets much worse with estimates of total costs of error ranging between 10% and 25% of project cost or between £10–25Bn per annum across the sector.

Working with our study group and members of their supply chains our research identified and ranked the construction activities which generate the most losses through error. In doing this we differentiated between building and civil engineering projects.

We also explored and ranked the root causes of error.

We have developed a strategy to address these root causes. This Strategy is set out in detail in “A Strategy For Change” published by the Get It Right Initiative in November 2015, and summarised below.
<h2>Strategic Aim</h2>
To reduce error significantly in the UK construction industry.
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To change the attitudes of those involved in the sector so that they care about and focus on reducing the number of errors and improving the quality in what they do.</li>
 	<li>To improve the knowledge across the sector so that all involved properly understand the ways that design and construction processes can be disrupted and how this can and often does lead to error and waste</li>
 	<li>To improve the decision making and planning skills across the sector so that all involved are able to react and adjust to unavoidable process disruption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Develop and implement a skills development program.</li>
 	<li> A campaign to change and align attitudes across the sector.</li>
 	<li> Process and system improvements.</li>
 	<li> Technology innovation.</li>
</ul>

Literature Review,The Literature Review researched all of the research data that was available worldwide into errors in construction. In particular a considerable amount of data came for Australia.Its conclusions were broadly similar to our research
Research Report,"The Research Report sets out how the research was carried out, what data was used  and the conclusions drawn"
Strategy for Change,"<h2>Our first piece of work has been to undertake a thorough piece of research to identify both the most economically significant errors and their causes.</h2>
The results of our research are set out in detail in the Get it Right Initiative Research Report (November 2015).

Key international studies suggest that the measured direct costs of avoidable errors are in the order of 5% of project value. This equates to approximately £5Bn per annum across the sector in the UK and is higher than average profit levels across the industry (around 3%).
<h2>When unmeasured and indirect costs are included the situation gets much worse with estimates of total costs ranging between 10% and 25% of project cost or between £10-25Bn per annum across the sector.</h2>
&nbsp;

Our research identified that the top ten root causes of error were:
<ul>
 	<li> Inadequate planning</li>
 	<li> Late design changes</li>
 	<li> Poorly communicated design information</li>
 	<li> Poor culture in relation to quality</li>
 	<li> Poorly coordinated design information</li>
 	<li> Inadequate attention paid in the design to construction</li>
 	<li> Excessive commercial (financial and time) pressure</li>
 	<li> Poor interface management and design</li>
 	<li> Ineffective communication between team members</li>
 	<li> Inadequate supervisory skills.</li>
</ul>
We have developed a strategy to address these root causes and this is set out below.
<h2>Strategic Aim:</h2>
• To improve construction productivity and quality by eliminating error.
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Create a culture and working environment to get it right from the start.</li>
 	<li>Change attitudes and harness leadership responsibility to reduce error and improve quality and productivity.</li>
 	<li>Engage all stakeholders in eliminating error from inception, through operation, to completion.</li>
 	<li>Share knowledge about error reduction processes and systems.</li>
 	<li>Improve skills across the sector creating a positive approach to pre-empting error.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activities:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Develop and implement an error reduction skills program across the sector.</li>
 	<li>Deliver a strategic awareness campaign to improve sector attitudes to error.</li>
 	<li>Develop improvements to processes, systems and technology to remove error.</li>
 	<li>Provide opportunities for members to share experience and to network.</li>
</ul>

GIRI Technology Research Report: Harnessing Technology to Minimise Error,"This report collects research led by the GIRI Technology Working Group investigating how technology can be harnessed to eliminate error, key areas worth pursuing and recommendations for application. The research was undertaken by Paul Trewavas CEng MICE, formerly of Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd.
<p class=""p1"">This report focuses on the five topics identified by GIRI which are the principal areas in which technology can be used to eliminate error: Offsite Manufacture, Standardisation, Improved Construction Processes, Error-Minimising Components and Automation. The report summaries current technology utilisation related to error minimisation and recommends further investigation.</p>"
July 2018 Synopsis - GIRI Design Guide: Improving Value by Reducing Design Error,"<p class=""p1"">Led by the GIRI Design Working group members of the Initiative, from across all disciplines, have collaborated to create this design guide: a set of thirteen principle recommendations to improve value by reducing error, that can be applied to any project, particularly at its commencement and during early design stages.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The purpose of this guide is to share knowledge across the Industry as to best practice when approaching projects with an aim to reduce error and increase productivity. It does not purport to be a ground-breaking report. It is a useful review and reminder of the key techniques that can be applied. The challenge is to apply these techniques in a consistent manner and to ensure that every project seeks to carry out these recommendations as a matter of routine. It will take determination and leadership to address them all.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The guide does not suggest preferred forms of procurement or contract to implement the recommendations, as experience has shown that with the right leadership, best practice can be delivered regardless of contract.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A key theme that features throughout these recommendations is to stand back, analyse the situation and develop a consistent plan, and once that plan is in place make sure it is adhered to, or allowed to flex as situations change.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The aim for this this synopsis is that it becomes a useful tool to support the design process and will be followed by the full detailed guide this Autumn. Your suggestions for improvement are welcomed, so please email us on <a href=""mailto:info@getitright.uk.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">info@getitright.uk.com</a> with your feedback which we will take into consideration for the full guide and its subsequent updates.</p>"
November 2018 - Guide to Improving Value by Reducing Design Error,"<p class=""p1"">Initial GIRI research revealed that a large proportion of construction errors, costing the UK industry billions a year, are rooted in deficiencies or changes in design. These research findings motivated GIRI Members, led by the GIRI Design Working group and from across all disciplines, to unite, share knowledge and collaborate to create a Design Guide to address the causes of these avoidable errors from design deficiencies.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This Guide to Improving Value by Reducing Error comprises of twelve principal recommendations that can be applied to any project, particularly at its commencement and during early design stages. The guide aims to share knowledge across the Industry as a useful tool, rather than presenting itself as a ground-breaking report, and serves as a reminder of the best practice techniques to follow when approaching projects.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The challenge the industry faces is to apply these recommendations in a manner that ensures they are adopted as a matter of routine. A concurrent theme throughout the guide is the ability to stand back, analyse the situation, develop a consistent plan, and once that plan is in place make sure it is adhered to, or allowed to flex as situations change. This applies to Clients, Designers, Contractors and Subcontractors at all stages of the design process from conception to specialist detailed designs. The question is, does the current Construction design process allow for this to happen?</p>
<p class=""p1"">A key philosophy of the Get It Right Initiative is that we should all learn from our mistakes by sharing those mistakes and the appropriate solutions across the Industry. We are sure that this guide can be improved with experience and use, so we are hoping that you will provide feedback with your comments and suggestions.</p>
