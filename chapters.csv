Introduction,"The Get it Right Initiative has been established to help the construction industry to understand the causes, and reduce the impacts, of error and rework. This section of the report looks at academic and industry research into error and rework in construction, and explores some of the proposals which have been made to reduce the cost of rework and improving quality. It is important to note at the outset that the definition of rework includes both necessary rework – arising from client changes – and unnecessary rework, brought about by errors in the development process. This cost of rework has become such an endemic feature in the construction process that contracting organisations now build expectations of time and cost overruns into their procurement processes (Love &amp; Li 2000) In the UK, the Egan Report – Rethinking Construction (Egan 1998) – suggested that up to 30% of construction is rework. The report went on to make suggestions as to how to reduce this figure, setting a target of 20% reduction in defects (on handover) per year, assuming that zero defect construction could be achieved in five years. The Egan recommendations covered procurement and efficiency enhancements, and adopting process improvements to increase consistency and efficiency. Such an improvement would have a dramatic impact on the costs of construction and contribute significantly towards the Construction 2025 targets of a 33% reduction in the initial cost of construction. However, while progress has been made in reducing error and rework since Egan, industry surveys suggest that progress remains slow. For example looking at the latest Glenigan construction industry KPI reports for Constructing Excellence, we can see that there is a marked improvement on defects at handover since 2001. There remains more to do, with only 71% of clients rating their satisfaction with regard to defects at handover as eight out of ten or better. The impact of rework and error is not a phenomenon restricted to the UK; work on the impacts and causes of rework has been undertaken in many countries, with key papers emanating from Australia, Singapore, South Africa, the USA, Canada and the UK."

Skills Development Programme,"A key finding of our study was that inadequate skills are a major contributor to errors in the construction process. This section sets out what we found and what we suggest should be done.
<h2>Skills to Focus On</h2>
The graph below shows how our study group would distribute expenditure to address the problem of error in construction. There is clearly a keen interest in improving skills as well as creating an appropriate culture in relation to quality and error reduction.

Detailed discussions with the study group suggest that the skills of most interest are related to planning, communication and supervision. This was true whether we were talking about trade skills or design skills. Discussions with our study group revealed a rich set of competencies that are required and these are summarised below:
<ul>
 	<li> To have and evaluate ideas against appropriate subjective and objective criteria</li>
 	<li> To exercise judgement and make good decisions</li>
 	<li> To be able to deal appropriately with change</li>
 	<li> To communicate effectively using means appropriate to the circumstances</li>
 	<li> To form and maintain effective working relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Base Knowledge Requirements</h2>
All of these competencies depend to some extent on having a broad knowledge of the whole process. A common observation was that poor decisions were often made, because of a lack of understanding of the implications. For example: designers who don’t know about the construction or commissioning process; buyers who don’t understand the implications of substituting one drainage pipe system for another; or contractors who don’t understand the significance of overloading a key structural element during installation.
<h2>Getting the Culture Right</h2>
As well as better knowledge of the overall procees it is important that all concerned develop and exercise respect for the others involved. It is often the case that a lack of knowledge of what others do goes with a lack of respect for them or their role and this greatly impedes effective relations and communication.

It is also critical that people need to want to do the job well. They need to have the right frame of mind and to believe in what they do. This applies equally to the person making sure that the site is a fit place to do the work well by keeping it clean and tidy as to the designer who will want to make sure that his or her details are clear and unambiguous so as to eliminate error.

These themes are common with those found in Cultural Awareness and Behavioural Safety Programmes that are currently used by the Industry.

Without wanting to diminish the Safety messages one proposal would be to adapt these programmes to include an approach to quality.
<blockquote>It is important that all concerned develop and exercise respect for the others involved.</blockquote>
Experience in developing a more effective Health &amp; Safety culture has taught us the importance of Clients and Shareholders in creating an environment that requires change led from the top level of construction companies. As such we recommend a programme of briefings targeted at major clients and appropriate industry analysts to raise awareness about the true cost of error.

We know that many people working in our industry take pride in their work and are frustrated when things go wrong. A key objective of the campaign described above is to get people to take pride in their work and to engage with reducing the amount of errors that are made.

We recommend that, as appropriate, we make use of the sort of change management techniques that have been deployed over the last few years in relationship to Health &amp; Safety
<h2>The Skills Development Programme</h2>
The points above form the basis for a skills development programme that we believe needs to be implemented across the construction sector. Recognising the complexity and scale of the sector we propose a two pronged approach:

a. New entrants to the construction sector through initial training and qualification

b. Existing workers in the construction sector through on the job training or CPD and re-qualification.

For new entrants our proposal is to work with those responsible for the qualification standards to ensure that the required competencies are identified at the correct level. In relation to trade qualifications this means working with relevant sector skills councils, including Construction Skills, and influencing the National Occupational Standards.

The Trailblazer Apprenticeships are a key entry route to the sector and we would look to work with this programme to ensure that the competencies described above are properly addressed through the apprenticeships.

In relation to Professional Qualifications this means working with the relevant Professional Institutions. In relation to existing workers we would work with those responsible for requalification or revalidation (ie through carding schemes) or for CPD through the Professional Institutions.

We believe that there will be a significant demand for training and development in this area from major employers and we expect both in-house and external commercial training companies to play a key role in this sort of skills development.

We would also seek to influence those responsible for the provision of skills training to develop a high quality offer in this area. Key players would include the CITB, CECA, FE and HE institutions, and the training arms of the Professional Institutions for example.

The techniques that we should use In all cases we believe that there is a need for blended learning techniques to be developed and implemented to facilitate efficient and cost effective training. Examples
of the more innovative sorts of techniques that we would expect to see are set out below. To develop broad knowledge of the construction sector we would advocate the use of tools like Engineering
Mastermind.

This is an online game which helps people to develop a broad knowledge of the construction industry through reward based game play. Similarly, we would expect construction activity simulators to be used to help develop planning skills.

For example Concrete Sim is a concept for an online simulator of concrete pours where the player plans and undertakes a concrete pour in a simulator environment. This is just a simplified version of a flight simulator but would allow the player to develop skills of planning and hone their skills in optimising activities and dealing with unexpected events like a pump failure in the middle of the operation.
Online videos showing key construction activities are already a key resource for construction workers and we advocate the development of a full and kite marked set of online videos for the UK construction industry. These would help in the development of skills both at the time of qualification but also serve as a refresher providing just in time competence!

Similarly, tools such as Student Studio could provide an excellent and cost effective means by which people develop an overview of the whole construction process.

Student Studio is an online platform that provides a range of structured role-play-based construction and engineering projects. Finally, the Constructionarium and the Big Rig are examples of educational techniques that allow the user to develop their construction skills outside the high pressure environment of the construction site.

We believe that the CITB should play a key role in developing such techniques."
Acknowledgements,"We held five productive meetings with the steering group. In addition we met on an individual basis with each of the companies represented on the steering group and a number of other companies as identified in section 4.2 below. All of these meetings were very open and very instructive.

We would like to thank all of the companies and people for all of their time and input. Many other people have given their time and knowledge, not least the 143 construction industry professionals who anonymously responded to an online questionnaire which was circulated by the Get It Right research team."
Improve Management Processes and Systems,"Through our research two processes have been identified as the key sources of error when they are poorly implemented:
• Design Management
• Construction Planning
Key issues in this area and our suggestions are set out below.
<h2>A common language to describe error</h2>
Our research showed that there is a general lack of coherence about the way we use and understand terms like: error, defect, cause, effect, direct vs indirect costs, tangible vs intangible impacts for example.
This is important because it impedes effective communication and the development of a shared understanding of the issue. This situation is analogous to the position relating to construction Health &amp; Safety
in the 1970s and 1980s before there was a common understanding of terms like risk, hazard, harm, mitigation, and so on.

A common language and understanding around the subject is essential.

In our view, the existence of a common language and understanding around the subject is essential if we are to make progress. As such we propose producing simple models describing the error process and its consequences using construction appropriate vocabulary for adoption across the sector.

In doing this we advocate careful consideration of the terms already in use and proper reference to other sectors like the automotive industry where they have more formalised and developed approaches to the subject of error.
<h2>Identifying errors and the costs of error</h2>
Our research reveals that, with a few notable exceptions, relatively little is done to identify and record the costs and causes of error in the construction sector.

Where data is collected it tends to relate to defects (ie the outcome of errors) at a contractual handover rather than the causes. The data collected usually relates to the number and type of defects with information about cost limited to the main contractor’s management costs. We found no evidence that designers were systematically collecting data about errors in their work.

As a result there is very little hard data produced about the costs and causes of error in the UK construction industry.
We agree with the saying that “if you can’t measure it you can’t manage it” and as such we believe that suitable measurement techniques need to be developed.

However, we consider it essential to avoid them creation of cumbersome, data heavy and ultimately impractical systems.

We believe that our industry can learn from others gathering data from complex systems. For example, in the public health sector indirect or proxy indicators and simple screening checks are used to understand what is happening and assess the health of an individual or group of individuals.

In our sector we use indirect indicators in relation to Health &amp; Safety when we measure the Accident Frequency Rate.

In effect we measure the number of “injuries causing greater than seven day absences” and draw conclusions about the overall H&amp;S condition of a project or company. This single measure approach is somewhat simplistic by comparison with the approaches used in the public health sector but is useful nonetheless.

We might consider developing a set of easy to obtain proxy indicators that taken together would provide a reliable indication of the type, frequency and cost of error.

For example, the number and type of Non Compliance Reports or defects on completion may be a reasonable indicator of the error rate. Data on NCRs is already routinely captured. Alternatively there may be more incentive to report the number of inspections passed first time.

Similarly, there was a widely held view in our study group that the quality of “housekeeping” on construction sites was a very good indicator of the quality of construction and the error rate.
The Considerate Contractor Scheme provides scores on the quality of housekeeping which may provide proxy indicators of error rate.

There was a view in the study group that features such as contract variations, programme delays, and staff turnover were all correlated with error.

We suggest that work is done to identify suitable indirect indicators of error. This work would involve research looking in detail at error rates on a representative group of projects to establish the most relevant indirect indicators and their relationship to error rates and cost. The indirect indicators could then be adopted more generally across the sector. The data collected would be used by individual organisations, projects or programmes to benchmark their performance and develop improvement strategies. It is recognised that there is at present a degree of nervousness in going down a route that would ultimately lead to organisations being required to publish data of this nature. This is due to fears that the data will be inconsistent and will therefore not be representative of the true picture. Work needs to be done to ensure consistent and correct reporting.

This is not dissimilar to the issues that were first faced when Health &amp; Safety data was published. In the long run if we are to eliminate error it will be important to find a way of publishing error data in a way that is acceptable to the majority.
<h2>The nature of the design process</h2>
Across the sector there is a surprising lack of a common understanding of the character of the design process.
Specifically, design is an intrinsically iterative process where propositions need to be modified as new information or insights occur.

In the early stages of design the iterations are healthy and welcome in the search for an optimal solution.

Similarly, in the early stages of the design process information is sparse and many assumptions are made.

The design ideas lack detail and design information is coarse. Many contractors fail to understand this fully, believing instead that designers and their clients are indecisive, vague and flaky!

By the construction stage iterations are much less welcome as they can be highly disruptive to the planned construction process and result in delay and increase the chances of error. During construction assumptions are dangerous and detailed information is essential.

Many clients and designers fail to realise this believing instead that the contractors are inflexible, demanding and uninterested in the quality of the outcome!

We believe that it would beneficial to our sector as a whole if all involved were to develop a proper and shared understanding of the real character of the design process. This would make clear that the process is one of refinement where the character of the information produced and levels of certainty are different at different stages of the process.

To this end we suggest the production of a simple but shared model characterising the construction design process which would be adopted in relevant training and educational programmes.

We believe that appropriate investment in the early stages of a project is essential in developing robust proposals which are properly thought through and less likely to need to be changed. It is of course important that money invested in the early stages is well spent and in our experience this is more likely when the Client works closely with the design team.
<h2>Design Management</h2>
The lack of a properly co-ordinated design results in clashes on site and consequent rework and delay.

The main reasons for this reported in our study are:

a. The lead designers and/or design managers lack the skill, fee or desire to properly co-ordinate the design;

b. The ambiguity and confusion about who is responsible for design co-ordination in some D&amp;B contracts; and

c. The trade specialists responsible for key parts of the design are not involved in the pre-construction phase and so design co-ordination happens very late in the overall process.

To deal with the first two of these, Clients and Contractors need to identify and appoint suitably qualified lead designers and design managers, make their responsibilities clear and pay them enough to do the job properly.

There was a view among some in our study group that there was a shortage of suitably skilled and experienced people to fulfil these roles. It was suggested by some that formal training of design managers was overly focused on management systems without enough attention being paid to developing knowledge of procurement &amp; construction practice or the effective management of multi-disciplinary teams.

Clients and Contractors need to identify and appoint suitably qualified lead designers and design managers.

As such we recommend that programmes of training for lead designers and design managers be reviewed to assess and where necessary address this deficiency.

The trade specialist input problem appears to be intractable given current procurement rules and practices.

Generally members of the study group agreed with the common view that the use of BIM during design development can facilitate spatial co-ordination and information handling and as such contribute to the reduction of error in construction.

The use of BIM should deliver a total rigorous design process from inception to completion and will be the key to good design delivery. Over time, the mandatory adoption of BIM should lead to better co-ordination of design and eliminate ambiguity about who is responsible for co-ordination.
<h2>Construction Planning</h2>
<blockquote>Our study group identified ineffective planning as the single biggest cause of errors in construction and several of the other causes in the top ten were planning related.</blockquote>
Several organisations identified the shortage of suitably skilled and experienced construction planners as problematic.

Our study group identified ineffective planning as the single biggest cause of errors in construction.

Some identified the mismatch between the stable and predictable environment assumed by many planners and planning systems, and the reality of many fast moving and changing construction projects.

Some advocated “collaborative planning” a technique that comes from the LEAN construction movement. Advocates reported that when properly used it was very effective at improving the quality and certainty of project outcomes.

Some observed that collaborative planning failed to deliver results when, as was often the case, the parties involved in the planning sessions:

• Did not have aligned contractual interests; or
• Were not empowered to make changes to work plans; or
• Did not know enough to be able to assess the impact of changes proposed on other activities.

Others observed that the uptake of LEAN techniques including collaborative planning remains small across the sector and that traditional planning approaches still predominate. These approaches tend to assume relatively small amounts of change during the process and can be cumbersome and inflexible.

A key issue is that although plans are made circumstanceswill certainly change, rendering the plan obsolete. We should not be surprised by this and indeed we need to plan for it. As an industry we tend to forget the plan and just carry on. We need to develop a standard practice for when things change.

In determining how to improve planning skills in the industry we need to consider the following features:

• Simplicity: Simple systems are easily applied and are
most likely to be used successfully.
• Contingency: A plan should make allowance for
alternative scenarios.
• Adaptability: A plan should be continuously reworked
throughout implementation.
• Resilience: Often it is not possible to immediately
understand the full consequences of change.

Where change is inevitable the system should maximize the team’s ability to quickly assess and respond to emerging requirements.
<h2>Sharing Best Practice about error reduction</h2>
There could be great benefit if we were better able to identify and share best practice. We see the Professional Institutions, trade organisations and major employers leading in this area.

A few examples that came out of our investigation that would fall into the category of best practice include:

• The use of samples or examples of built work showing clearly the quality level required.
• Safety and Quality inductions on projects.
• Regular Board level reviews of performance in relation to quality and error.
• Regular Director level site inspections focused on quality and error as well as safety.
• Proper consideration of quality and error rates in the selection of contractors
<h2></h2>"
Terminology,"Across the construction industry there is wide variation in the language used to discuss errors / defects / snags / rework requirements / non-conformances etc. After investigation and discussion with the Steering Group we have adopted the following definitions for the purpose of the Get It Right initiative:
<ul>
 	<li>An error is any action or inaction which results in a requirement for re-work, a requirement for extra work, or produces a defect,</li>
 	<li>A defect is any failure to meet the project requirements at a handover.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

A handover may be from one contractor to another contractor on completion of a package, or a handover may be from a Tier 1 Contractor to a Client on completion of a project. Note that the results of errors which are resolved before a handover are not considered defects. The labour, materials, plant and other resources used in correcting an error are direct costs. The effect on following works and the costs to other parties are indirect costs.

For example if the steel frame was completed late due to correcting an error the cladding contractor would have costs overcoming delays. Regardless of who picks up the contractual liability there is still a cost to the project. A latent defect remains in place after the project has been accepted by the client and any 'defects liability period' has passed.

Unrecorded process waste includes errors which occur, are identified and are corrected without being recorded - for example reinforcement may be refixed without costs being recorded. Unrecorded process waste also includes errors which are not corrected but which do not compromise the end performance of the project - for example concrete used as backfill in place of lower grade fill."
Improve Construction Technology,"<h2>Off-site manufacture</h2>
It is clear that off-site manufacture under controlled conditions can greatly reduce the risk of error in the fabrication and assembly process.

We recommend that in the pursuit of error reduction clients, designers and contractors consider pre-fabrication and off-site manufacture properly throughout the design and construction process.

However, there are a number of challenges to widespread adoption of off-site manufacture across the construction sector. Two of the most significant of these challenges are that using current procurement models off-site manufacture often appears to cost more and be relatively inflexible to change.

We recommend that research into the comparative costs f traditional on-site versus off site approaches properly considers the error costs.

In part a failure to recognise and factor in the full cost of error is one of the reasons why traditional methods appear cheaper than off-site methods when procurement decisions are made.

There may be value in increasing the amount of pre-fabrication in construction projects through regulation. This approach has been used to improve the energy performance of buildings and their
accessibility over recent years. However, in the current political environment it is hard to see any interest in regulatory approaches that might result in increased construction costs.
<h2>Standardisation</h2>
Standardisation of processes or construction elements tends to reduce errors, provided of course that the process or element is itself sound!

It is sometimes argued that there is a conflict between standardisation and “design quality”. Recognising the need for appropriate contextually responsive design it is nonetheless important that we standardise where practical.

As such we encourage clients, designers, contractors and their supply chains to work together to find opportunities for standardisation where appropriate.
<h2>Improvement of construction processes</h2>
One way of reducing errors is to develop and use processes that minimise the risk of error. This is similar in principle to the philosophy that has been developed and used to in relation to Health &amp; Safety risks. Of course it is important to strike a suitable balance between reducing error and maintaining production output rates.

We recommend that a comprehensive review is undertaken into standard construction activities
and processes to identify and develop modified approaches to reduce the risk of error whilst
maintaining production rates.

We believe that this sort of practical research might be appropriately undertaken or arranged by the CITB and or the BRE with input from the trade federations.
<h2>Error minimising construction components</h2>
The more fiddle and faff in a construction task the more likely you are to have errors. This is particularly true for fit-out operations involving connections.

We believe that a concerted effort working with manufacturers to develop standard and practical
details would yield real benefit for the sector.

Details should be developed so that they give a clear indication that the connection is made and secure, /rather like the clunk click that you get with a car seat belt.

There is a need to look outside our industry to learn how others have tackled these issues.
We recommend that a working group is set up to review standard construction technologies and to identify and /as appropriate develop modified approaches.

Again we believe that this sort of practical research might be appropriately undertaken or arranged by /the CITB or BRE with input from the trade federations and manufacturers.

We should engage with the industry to establish those areas and components which cause the most problems so that the research can be focused on actual needs to maximise the benefits."
Financial and Economic Impact of Error,"The financial and economic impact of error and rework in construction varies widely by project, with reported impacts ranging from 0-80% of project costs.

A commonly reported average of 5% (approximately £5bn in the UK) is supported by several papers. However, in the context of a specific project this average is almost meaningless.

Discussion The Egan report quotes a (1998) figure of 30% for the cost of rework in the USA, Scandinavia and the UK. Love &amp; Edwards (2004) showed that earlier work on rework costs reported values of between 3 and 15 per cent of a project’s contract value; Barber et al. (2000) suggest rework might be as high as 23% of contract value; Simpeh et al. (2015) found that the total rework costs range from 0% to 75%.

The degree of variability is akin to another study undertaken by Love (2002), where some respondents reported rework costs to be less than 1% of a project’s original contract value, while others reported them to be as high as 80%’ However, as rework continues to be a significant issue for the industry, commentators tend to put the cost of rework at around 5%. For example, a geniebelt.com blog post cites the 5% figure.

This would equate the cost of rework in the UK industry to £5.1bn. Several recent studies have provided support for use of 5% as an average approximation of rework in construction. For example, Hwang et al (2009) undertook a new study of 177 construction projects and found that the average owner reported rework cost was 5.0% across all projects. Further, research by the USA’s Construction Industry Institute (CII) reveals that direct costs caused by rework average 5% of total construction costs (CII 2005) (but range from 0-25%). While across projects the average cost may be in the region of 5%, the reported disparity indicates that the degree and cost of rework is highly context sensitive."
Principal Causes of Error,"The answer to the question as to the principal causes of error and rework in the construction industry is not straightforward. Reason (1995) describes errors as arising in one of three ways:

• failures of intention where the plan is inadequate (failure to plan). Reason (1995) terms these failures of intention ‘mistakes’ and distinguishes between :  rule based mistakes which involve the misapplication of a rule, the application of the wrong rule, or not applying the right rule for a given context; and knowledge based mistakes which occur in novel situations and require significant cognitive processing, which is prone to bias.

• failures in execution (slips and lapses), where a plan is adequate but the actions do not go as planned. These can be further sub-categorised as failures of  recognition;  attention;  memory; or  selection. Slips and lapses usually occur in familiar surroundings while someone is performing a routine task.

• deliberate violations which can arise from:  routine violations, or cutting corners;  optimising violations, to address a personal objective (such as going home early) rather than task objectives; and  situational violations which ‘offer the only path available to getting the job done, or when the procedures are seen to be inappropriate for the present situation’.

Each of these causes has different psychological origins and requires different counter measures (see Michie et al. 2011 for a discussion on diagnosing and encouraging behaviour change).

These classifications provide a comprehensive basis to analyse the reason an identified error was made. However, in a complex supply chain the root cause of an error may not be immediately apparent. Accordingly, researchers have also analysed error and rework caused by the nature of the deviation: carelessness, ignorance, or recklessness; by their consequences or causes (Reason 1995); by type of deviation; by construction phase origin; or by cause type – error, omission or change. There is little agreement in the literature as to which is the most appropriate approach to recording errors. Indeed, Reason (1995) suggests that there is no one taxonomy which can serve all needs in describing errors, and as such, the search for a unifying taxonomy may ultimately be fruitless."
Tools and Methods,"Due to the complex nature of the construction industry, and the variety of definitions and interpretations of error or rework, there has been little agreement as to a common classification system for recording errors and rework. This leads to uncertainty over the true scale and source of the issue.

There are many quality tools available to help to trace and classify error, for example ‘3 Legs, 5 Why’, Root Cause Analysis, 8D, Failure Mode &amp; Effects Analysis (FMEA) but it is not clear from the literature to what extent these are used in the construction industry.

Discussion To enable consistency of reporting, researchers have sought, and continue to seek, a common taxonomy to describe causes of error and rework. Unfortunately because of the complex and interconnected nature of the industry, there has been little agreement between authors as to which taxonomy use. This section explores the various views which researchers have developed of the problem."
A Campaign,"We propose to develop and implement the “Get It Right” campaign to change and align attitudes across the sector so that all involved are committed to reducing errors and improving the
quality of what we do.
<h2>Aim</h2>
To change and align attitudes across the sector so that all involved are committed to reducing errors in what we do.
<h2>Audience</h2>
Clients, consultants, contractors, regulators, education and training providers, Professional Institutions and trade bodies.
<h2>Message</h2>
1) Error is a big problem in our industry.

• It results in wasted materials, energy, time and money.
• The annual cost of error in our industry is estimated to exceed £10Bn. This is enough to build 500 new secondary schools or 100,000 houses a year.
• It damages the reputation and standing of our industry making it more difficult to recruit the skilled people that we need.

2) Take pride in what you do
• What you do matters.
• Do it as well as you can and be proud.
• Imagine yourself standing with your grandchildren in front of something that you have helped to build saying “We did that”.
• You are members of one of the most respected professions.
• Remember that we build and maintain the stuff that makes civilised life possible.

3) Control the controllable and follow the plan
• Errors are nearly always the consequence of deviating from the plan or a failure to comply with the planned process.
• For this reason wherever possible we should follow planned processes.
• If you think of a better way to do something, beware, you may not know all of the potential implications, and check before you revise the process.

4) Plan and re-plan carefully when you need to
• Construction projects happen over relatively long timeframes in complex environments that are difficult
to control.
• This means that we have to adapt our processes as we go along more often than industries like car making.
• This isn’t an excuse for making mistakes but it means that to avoid errors we have to be better at planning and re-planning as we go along.

5) Respect the others involved in the process and learn about what they do
• Errors are usually the result of bad decisions. Bad decisions are often made because you don’t have all of the information or because you don’t know about or understand the potential consequences of
your decision.
• Construction projects are complex and involve lots of people doing different things for different reasons. Your decision making will be better if you understand who is involved and what they do. If you are in any doubt then ask.

6) Sometimes it is just better to stop!
• Construction is a “can do” industry. We hate stopping or slowing down and when we encounter a problem we want to solve it and move on.
• Unfortunately, when we don’t have all of the information necessary and we don’t revise the plan properly, we may just make things worse.
• We never have time to Get it Right. We always have time to put it right.
• So we need to know when we are out of our depth, stop what we are doing and ask for help and guidance. That is what the team is for!

We never have time to Get it Right.

We always have time to put it right."
Methodology,"We used the Grounded Theory Method to collect and analyse information on error in the UK construction industry, the causes of error and the methods used for avoiding error. The analysis of the data collected identified the areas of work in which error is financially most significant, the financially most significant causes of error and the most effective methods for avoiding error and minimising the consequences of error.

We used the Delphi Method to rank the results of the Grounded Theory Method analysis and to assess the relative financial impact of:

- The direct costs of error,

- The indirect costs of error,

- Latent defects and

- Unrecorded process waste.

The Delphi Method was also used to identify the most effective methods of reducing the financial impact of error in the construction industry. An anonymous online survey of construction industry professionals was used to assess the results of the ranking analyses completed using the Delphi Method. If there were large divergences between the rankings arising from the Delphi Method analysis and the online survey this might indicate that the Delphi Method results are not representative of the view of the wider industry.

A Literature Review was completed and the results are compared with the findings of the Grounded Theory and the Delphi Method analyses. The Literature Review also provided an approximate value of the direct costs of error as a percentage of the total cost of construction. This figure was used in combination with the results of the Delphi Method analysis to estimate the total financial cost of error in the UK construction industry. The results of the above were used to inform development of a strategy to reduce error in the UK construction industry and to address deficiencies in skills within the UK construction industry. The Steering Group provided guidance throughout this phase of the Get It Right Initiative.
<h2>4.1. The steering group</h2>
The steering group met five times. Its key role was to act as a sounding board to the results of the research at each stage and to inform the next stage of research. The steering group members were the participants in the Delphi Method analyses.

The steering group discussions were conducted on the basis no information would be published that would allow any opinion, error, defect, error incidence rate or defect incidence rate to be linked to a particular company or individual.

The members of the Steering Group are listed in Section 1 of this report.
<h2>4.2. Collection and Analysis of Information using the Grounded Theory Method</h2>
We have adopted a version of the “Grounded Theory” research method for this project. Rather than a
classical research approach where you postulate a hypothesis and then attempt to prove or disprove it, the Grounded Theory Method sets questions and then attempts through investigation to identify the most plausible answers.
Our research questions were:
What are the principal systemic errors in the UK construction industry?
What are the causes of error in the UK construction industry?
What are methods used to capture information about the financial cost of error in the UK construction industry?
What are the most effective methods for avoiding error and minimising the consequences of error?

We used three methods to collect data:

A workshop with the steering group,
Structured interviews with the members of the steering group and a number of other companies in the sector;
Collection of quantitative data relating to individual error occurrences. This included:
A descriptions of each of the errors,
A description of the causes of each of the error occurrences,
An assessment of the financial cost of each of the error occurrences.
This information was collected from the participants in the structured interviews.
The data was analysed by the Get It Right Initiative team as it was collected. The emerging findings were discussed in steering group meetings to draw on the expertise of the Steering Group members for the identification of theories.
The structured interviews were completed and the quantitative data was collected on the basis that no information would be published that would allow any opinion, error, defect, error incidence rate or defect incidence rate to be linked to a particular company or individual.
The structured interviews were conducted with the following nineteen companies:
Alinea Consulting (Cost Consultant)
Anglian Water (Client)
BAM Nuttall (Main Contractor)
Berkeley Group (Main Contractor)
Byrne Group (Trade Contractor)
Carillion (Main Contractor)
Costain (Main Contractor)
GRAHAM Construction (Main Contractor)
Keltbray (Trade Contractor)
Prater Limited - Lindner UK Group (Trade Contractor)
Scotch Partners (Designer)
Sir Robert McAlpine (Main Contractor)
Southern Water (Client)
Stanhope (Client)
Taylor Woodrow (Main Contractor)
Wates (Main Contractor)
<h2>4.3. Analysis of the Grounded Theory results using the Delphi Method</h2>
The Delphi Method is a system for achieving well considered consensus among experts. In the Delphi
Method a group of experts anonymously reply to questionnaires and subsequently receive feedback of the ‘group response’. After the feedback the experts again anonymously reply to questionnaires. The process is repeated until a predefined stop criterion is achieved. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in the light of the replies of other members of their panel. It is intended that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the ""correct"" answer. We used the Delphi Method to rank the results of the Grounded Theory Method analysis and to assess the relative financial impact of:
The direct costs of error,
The indirect costs of error,
Latent defects and
Unrecorded process waste.

The Delphi Method was also used to identify the most effective methods of reducing the financial impact of error in the construction industry.

The panel of experts was made up of the following members of the Steering Group:

David Anderson Head of Business Process &amp; Quality BAM Nuttall
Damian Leydon Operations Director Berkeley Group
Howard Tinkler Quality &amp; Compliance Director Carillion
Paul Cannon Commercial Manager Carillion
Clive Loosemore Project Director Costain
David Ansell Associate Director Prater
Ian Kirkaldy Chief Engineer Southern Water
Barrie Nightingale Director T. Clarke
Emma McNab Business Excellence Manager Taylor Woodrow
John Shannon Programme Director Wates

Members of the Research Team acted as the facilitators.

The experts anonymously answered four questions:

The first question entailed ranking the areas of work which had been identified by the Grounded Theory Method as being the areas where error has a significant financial impact. The experts were
asked to rank the areas of work according to their assessment of the financial impact of error in each of the areas of work.
The second question required the experts to rank the root causes of error which had been identified by the Grounded Theory Method as having a significant financial impact. The experts were asked to rank the root causes of error according to their assessment of the financial impact of each of the root causes of error.
The third question asked the experts to assess the relative financial impact of: the direct costs of error, the indirect costs of error, latent defects and unrecorded process waste.
In the fourth question the experts were asked first to assess how spend should be distributed across the areas of work to achieve the maximum reduction in the cost of error, and second to assess how spend should be allocated within each of the areas of work.

Each of the questions also asked the expert to identify:

Whether the organisation that the expert works for is primarily a trade contractor, a main contractor, a designer or a client.

Whether the work of the organisation that the expert works for relates primarily to Civil Engineering or Buildings.

On completion of the first round of answers to the four questions the group response was fed back to the experts. After a facilitated discussion of the group response the experts anonymously answered the same four questions.
Two rounds of answers to the questions was the predetermined stop criterion.
<h2>4.4. Assessment of the results of the ranking analysis completed using the Delphi Method</h2>
We used an anonymous online survey of construction industry professionals to assess the results of the ranking analyses completed using the Delphi Method. If there were large divergences between the rankings arising from the Delphi Method analysis and the online survey this might indicate that the Delphi Method results are not representative of the view of the wider industry.
A link to the questionnaire was circulated by members of the Steering Group to the contractors in their supply chain. A link to the questionnaire was also circulated by the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (CECA) to their members.

All questions were answered anonymously.

The survey first asked respondents to identify:

Whether the organisation that the respondent works for is primarily a trade contractor, a main
contractor, a designer or a client.
Whether the work of the organisation that the respondent works for relates primarily to Civil
Engineering or Buildings.
The respondents were then asked two questions

Q1. The first question entailed ranking the areas of work which had been identified by the Grounded Theory Method as being the areas where error has a significant financial impact.

The respondents were asked to rank the areas of work according to their assessment of the financial impact of error in each of the areas of work.

Q2. The second question required the respondents to rank the root causes of error which had been
identified by the Grounded Theory Method as having a significant financial impact. The respondents were asked to rank the root causes of error according to their assessment of the financial impact of each of the root causes of error.

After completing the first and second questions respondents were invited to add discursive comment. The principal purpose of this section of the survey was to enable respondents to make comment if they felt that the items identified by the Grounded Theory Method failed to include financially significant factors.
The pages from the online questionnaire are included in Appendix A.
<h2>4.5. Literature Review</h2>
A literature review was completed in two phases.
The purpose of the first phase of the literature review was to provide an awareness of the work which has been completed by others and ensure that the research team did not repeat work completed by others. The first phase of the literature review informed the initial discussions of the Steering Group in which the strategy for this phase of the Get It Right Initiative was agreed.

The second phase of the literature review was more detailed. The second phase of the literature review was used:

1. As a comparator for the results of the Delphi Method analysis. If there were large discrepancies between the rankings arising from the Delphi Method analysis and the results of previous studies this might indicate that the Delphi Method results are not representative of the view of the wider industry.

2. To inform the development of a strategy to reduce error in the UK construction industry and to
address deficiencies in skills within the UK construction industry.

3. The Literature Review also provided an approximate value of the direct costs of error as a
percentage of the total cost of construction. This figure was used in combination with the results of the Delphi Method analysis to estimate the total financial cost of error in the UK construction industry.

The second phase of the literature review was not available until after the experts had answered the Delphi Method questions thus avoiding introducing concepts from the literature into the experts’ answers. The literature review is included in Appendix B."
Results,"<h2>5.1. Collection and Analysis of Information using the Grounded Theory Method</h2>
As described above, we used three methods to collect data:

A workshop with the Steering Group,

Structured Interviews with the members of the steering group and a number of other companies in the sector;

Collection of quantitative data relating to individual error occurrences. This included:
<ul>
 	<li>A descriptions of each of the errors,</li>
 	<li>A description of the causes of each of the error occurrences,</li>
 	<li>An assessment of the financial cost of each of the error occurrences.</li>
</ul>
This information was collected from the participants in the structured interviews. The Steering Group workshop and the Structured Interviews were very effective and provided useful data. The collection of quantitative data was less effective. Few of the organisations that we interviewed had detailed quantitative data relating to errors. Where information was available the financial details generally related solely to the direct cost of error to the organisation being interviewed, rarely was information available on the cost (direct or indirect) to other parties. The quantitative data that was available all related solely to the direct cost of recorded error. Although the information relating to individual error occurrences was limited, we were able to use the data that was provided about turnover and the reported total direct cost of error to individual organisations to review estimates of the total direct cost of recorded error. Tier 1 Contractors have an overview of the construction process and provided useful information about the incidence and impact of error across the different trades. The initial cost of errors is incurred by the Tier 2 Contractors and this cost is often invisible both to Tier 1 Contractors and to end Clients.
<h2>5.1.1. Areas of work in which errors occur with greatest frequency</h2>
The limited availability of quantitative data has made it impossible for us to identify the errors that have the largest financial impact in the UK construction industry.

We have been able to identify the areas of work in which errors occur with greatest frequency, as reported by our study group. The ranking in the table below is by the reported frequency of occurrence of error. The ranking does not necessarily reflect the economic significance, as some errors whilst frequent may have low cost impact.

1. In Situ Concrete
2. Drainage
3. Piling
4. Mechanical Systems
5. Finishes
6. Damage to completed works
7. Facades / Cladding
8. Electrical Systems
9. Roads and Pavements
10. Roofing
11. Controls /
12. Timber
13. Setting out
14. Steelwork coatings
15. Temporary works
16. External works
17. Structural steel
18. Lifts
19. Cold bridging
20. Damage to live services
21. Underground waterproofing
22. Utility connections
23. Tunnels
24. Masonry
25. Earthworks
26. Basement waterproofing

Timber errors were reported have a relatively higher frequency but lower financial impact.
Errors in setting out were reported to be low frequency but high cost.
Some respondents reported a very high rate of error in steel coatings with a high knock on effect on following trades. Although reported to be areas of work in which there is a lower frequency of occurrence of errors ""Underground Waterproofing"" and “Basement Waterproofing” were reported to be areas of work in which the financial impact of error is significant.
<h2>5.1.2. The root causes of error</h2>
The list below sets out the root causes of error that were reported within our study group. The ranking here is by frequency of reporting. The ranking does not necessarily reflect the economic significance as some of the root causes, whilst frequent, may have low cost impact.

It was reported that although the errors and defects vary between trades, the causes of the defects are often the same.

1. Management and Planning
2. Communications
3. Workmanship
4. Design
5. Materials
6. Interface Design and Management
7. Commercial Pressures
8. Late changes
9. Information overload
10. Inadequate training
11. Setting out
12. Fabrication
13. Lack of focus on quality
14. Designers having a poor understanding of details
15. Design fees
16. Late surveys and investigations
17. Programme
18. Time
19. Core skills
20. Outside of core geographical range of work
21. Motivation
<h2>Management and Planning</h2>
Lack of planning at all levels (including operatives) is a key cause of error.

There was a view that planning skills are not as good as necessary particularly when planning involves co-ordination across trades.
There are often valid reasons why work does not proceed in accordance with the plan. Once the works start to deviate from the plan matters quickly go from bad to worse.
There is often insufficient supervision of site works. Supervisors are often insufficiently briefed or trained on how to supervise the trades and techniques on progress on that day: The same person may be involved in supervising a wide range of different trades.

Scarce resource for supervision of site works is often poorly allocated to areas where the most work is visible, rather than to the areas where there is the greatest risk of error. Works that are difficult to access and inspect often suffer from a lack of site supervision and inspection.
There is often insufficient checking as the work progresses; the consequence is that the financial cost of errors is increased.
Poorly aligned package scope and trade contractor skills can result in error. This is particularly the case when specialist trade contractors are required to manage further subcontractors.

There is a general determination to get it done so that subsequent works can proceed. Sometimes it appears easier just to do something than it is to take the time to work out what is the right thing to do. All of the study group have talked about problems arising because of a failure to make time to plan or to find out how the work should be done.

As an industry we have a real “can do” approach. We are instinctively keen to get on with each stage of a project and often proceed before the work has been fully planned. This “can do” approach is present across the industry, ranging from a tradesman who starts work before he or she has fully thought through what they should be doing to construction work started before the design is complete (thereby risking design changes with all the costs and disruption that can incur).

We never have time to get it right. We always have time to put it right.

It is sometimes difficult for staff to ask for help. There is a lack of awareness that one person cannot be an expert about everything.
<h2>Communication</h2>
Communication between all parties was reported to be a key cause of error. This included all forms of communications: written, drawn and verbal.
Communication ‘up the chain’ can be a particular problem:
<ul>
 	<li>Site operatives sometimes lack the confidence or motivation to ask questions or make
comment. Sometimes site operatives are insufficiently heard.</li>
 	<li>Site culture or relationships sometimes make it difficult for suppliers to discuss in good time
the possibility of a missed delivery date.</li>
</ul>
Many examples were given of people not being able to express uncertainty or ignorance to their superiors or workmates.

Task Briefings sometimes concentrate on the safe way of doing the work and fail to address the technical requirements.
Documents, particularly specifications, are often too long and contain much irrelevant information. Irrelevant information is often left in because the person preparing the document lacked the
experience to know what is unnecessary – or else information is left in “just in case” which makes it difficult to identify the information that is relevant.

Some respondents were sceptical that BIM provides real benefits.

There is a lot of emphasis in method statements as to how to do the work safely but there is rather less so on how to do the work without error.
<h2>Workmanship</h2>
It was widely reported that errors in workmanship are only rarely a result of a lack of skill on the part of the site operative.

Workmanship and operative technical ability are not generally seen as one of the principal causes of error, although there are isolated cases of poor workmanship or technical ability that do result in significant error. For example, it is not generally felt that errors in brickwork arise because bricklayers are not capable of mixing mortar and laying bricks, rather that for one reason or another they do not do what they are capable of doing consistently enough.

From the discussions it was understood that the errors assigned to ‘workmanship’ relate generally to failures in planning the task rather than to technical competence.

A view that has come up repeatedly is that people lack sufficient contextual knowledge to be able to complete their work effectively. In particular a lack of proper understanding of the roles undertaken and challenges faced by others involved in the construction process often results in inappropriate decisions or actions being taken. The study group have an almost endless supply of examples where errors have arisen as a result of this mutual ignorance. A few examples are given below as illustrations of situations that appear to be commonplace within the industry:

In ignorance a designer unnecessarily specifies fixings from a manufacturer’s catalogue that are
not stock items, resulting in procurement delays and consequent changes to planned construction sequence.
The procurement team substitute the specified 200m of 150mm diameter clay pipe with 200mm of 150mm diameter plastic pipe (to reduce cost) without understanding that the ground on the
site in question has relatively high levels of hydrocarbon contamination and that the plastic is notsuitable, with the outcome that the Contractor has to dig up and replace the entire drain run.
The bricklayer uses 10.5N 100mm blocks to build the non-load bearing partitions which only require 3.6N blocks not realising that they are a relatively long lead item specifically intended for the load bearing walls nearby. The outcome in this case was delay and additional costs incurred to replace the 10.5N blocks.

Interestingly in none of these examples did the error result in a defect, although all were relatively costly for the projects concerned.
<h2>Design</h2>
Design Changes (late or otherwise) were identified as a key cause of error.
Designs, and detailing in particular, are sometimes unsuitable.
<h2>Materials</h2>
It was reported that errors arising from problems with materials were often a result of late changes. It was reported that late changes in materials are often made by people who do not understand the effect of the change being made – often the person making the change is unaware that they have ‘made a change’. For example it was reported that buyers sometimes order alternatives without being aware that there are real technical differences between the more expensive product specified and the cheaper alternative.

Materials are sometimes changed because the item that was specified cannot be supplied in the time that is available.
<h2>Interface Design and Management</h2>
It was reported that, as well as the design and coordination of interfaces, tier 2 Contractors are often put under pressure by late handover from previous trades which contributes to errors.

It was reported that when a tier 2 contractor performs well they may be inundated with work without adequate consideration of capacity and that this does result in errors.

Several of the study group have identified poor management and planning associated with interfaces
between different systems and trades as being a particular problem.
<h2>Setting out</h2>
Although this was reported to be a cause of error, we consider incorrect setting out to be an error in itself with the costs arising being an indirect cost of the setting out error.
<h2>Fabrication</h2>
Although this was reported to be a cause of error, we consider incorrect fabrication to be an error in itself with the costs arising being an indirect cost of the setting out error.
<h2>5.1.3. Capturing the cost of error</h2>
There is significant variation in whether and how companies collect and report the costs of errors and defects. Most companies recognise that there is a cost issue with errors but it appears that none is clear as to the full extent of those costs.

Few of the organisations that we interviewed had detailed quantitative data relating to errors. Where information was available the financial details generally related solely to the direct cost of error to the organisation being interviewed, rarely was information available on the cost (direct or indirect) to other parties. All of the systems that we saw only capture the direct cost of error, and do that only partially.

None of the organisations that we interviewed was able to provide data relating to indirect costs or unrecorded process waste, although some participants were willing to express a view.

The direct cost of errors which result in defects (a defect is any failure to meet the project requirements at a handover)

Where Contractors do record the results of error the records generally relate to failures to meet the project requirements at handovers – “defects”.

Some of the organisations that we interviewed have detailed records of pre-completion defects while others have details of post completion defects. None of the organisations that we interviewed had information available on both. It was reported in some organisations that the board was principally interested in the cost of latent defects since these were perceived to affect ‘the bottom line’.

Several organisations had systems in place which did not focus on cost of error, but instead recorded the number of defects remaining on completion or, in different organisations, the number of defects reported and resolved during the construction process. None recorded everything.

There was generally more formalisation of the error recording systems in organisations with a larger proportion of large publically funded projects.
Most contractors acknowledge that the recording systems which they use do not allow them to capture the cost of error in some areas. For example some Tier 1 Contractors reported that the costs of M&amp;E defects are not disclosed by Tier 2 Contractors.

There was insufficient standardisation in the recording of error in the study group for us to use the detailed quantitative data which we did receive from a number of the study group to make a meaningful assessment of the cost of individual error types.

The bulk of the direct cost of error relates to materials, plant and labour costs. These costs are carried by the Tier 2 Contractors. We were not able to obtain good data on the direct cost of error to Tier 2 Contractors.

The direct cost of error to Tier 1 Contractors is largely associated with the additional management associated with rectifying errors. A review of the data from the Tier 1 Contractors suggests that the direct cost of managing errors which result in defects is in the range of 0.5% – 1.0% of project costs. Not surprisingly the total direct cost of errors which result in defects to Tier 1 Contractors with significant direct labour costs is reported to be substantially above 1.0%.

Tier 1 Contactor costs for managing construction projects are generally in the order of 10% - 20% of the total cost of construction (depending on sector and project type). Therefore the reported direct cost of errors which result in defects to Tier 1 Contractors falls in the range 2.5% (0.5% / 20%) to 10% (1% / 10%) and is probably typically around 5% of turnover.
<h2>The direct cost of errors which are resolved before a handover – “unrecorded process waste”</h2>
Very few Contractors record errors and the associated rework and extra work costs that are incurred before handovers. The direct costs of errors which are resolved before a handover are very rarely recorded.

Most of the direct costs of errors which are resolved before a handover are incurred by Tier 2 Contractors and below.

It is likely that only a relatively small proportion of the total direct cost of error arises from errors which result in defects. The majority of the direct cost of error is understood to arise from errors which are resolved before a handover and which are not recorded as defects.

Therefore the majority of the direct cost of error is, in effect, experienced as “process waste” at Tier 2 and below. We were not able to obtain sufficient quantitative data relating to unrecorded process waste to report a cross industry figure.

When working with the NEC form of contract Tier 1 Contractors are sometimes rewarded if “NonConformances” amount to less than 2% of the contract value. In these cases the relevant “NonConformances” are items identified at handover by the Client’s Representative. We have been informed that the results of the majority of errors are usually corrected earlier, after having been identified during inspection by the Tier 2 Contractor or the Tier 1 Contractor. This indicates that the direct cost of error is generally substantially greater than 2% of the project cost.
<h2>The indirect cost of errors</h2>
Generally Contractors were not able to provide an estimate of the indirect cost of error. One respondent estimated the indirect cost of error to the organisation to amount to an uplift of around 40% on the direct cost of error.
<h2>The total cost of errors</h2>
No Contractors were able to provide an estimate of the total cost of error.
All respondents agreed that the cost of error was substantially greater than the recorded cost. Few were able to provide an informed estimate of the total cost of error.
Respondents told us that they believe the cost of error to Tier 2 Contractors in some trades to be
between 20% and 25% of turnover. The respondents were not able to provide evidence to support these statements.

Based on the discussion above it appears highly probable that the total cost of error in construction is considerably greater than 10% of the total cost of construction.

Tier 1 Contractors have very little understanding of the true cost of error which is borne by their supply team.
It appears perhaps not surprising that Clients are largely unaware of the amount of error embedded in the construction process or the consequent costs to them of these errors.

There is some evidence to suggest that whilst the initial costs associated with errors occur in Tier 2 and below, the root causes may sit outside their control.
<h2>5.1.4. Methods used for avoiding error and minimising the consequences of error</h2>
Our research has also identified that most Contractors have a quality management system which is, in part,intended to reduce error and the associated financial impact. Several different theoretical frameworks have been used as a basis for these quality management systems and there does not appear to be an agreed industry standard.

Although different Contractors use different systems, the analysis demonstrates that adoption of systems designed to reduce error can deliver substantial financial savings.

In general Contractors that focus on large public sector projects have a more developed system for recording and assessing the results of error. Contractors working on smaller private sector projects are, in general, likely to use a less developed system or to have no formal system in place.

A number of companies have some excellent methods for eliminating error. These included quality circles, encouraging feedback from the workforce, benchmarks, use of mock ups and prototypes, encouraging people to stand back and think, encouraging people to ask when they are not sure, and quality risk assessments. The best examples of Good Practice come from those companies that have effective senior leadership interest in quality and that build an effective culture.

Among the people that we interviewed there is a strong school of thought that if you get the culture right everything else falls into place, including a reduction in the occurrence of error. It was emphasised that leadership is critical to definition of the culture of an organisation.

A demonstrated interest in quality by a Company’s Board has a positive effect on reducing defects, markedlymore so than a market approach which assumes that defects will be eliminated by focussing on costs.

Sites which adopt practices which result in high quality with few defects are generally safe sites almost certainly because there is good management.

It was reported that fewer errors occur on projects where the Client has put in systems to monitor quality.

It was also reported that there are fewer errors on projects where Clients demonstrate an interest in quality.

Independent checks completed by an external audit organisation were reported to be an effective means of reducing error.

<h2>5.2. Analysis of the Grounded Theory results using the Delphi Method</h2>
We used the Delphi Method to rank the results of the Grounded Theory Method analysis and to assess the relative financial impact of:
- The direct costs of error,
- The indirect costs of error,
- Latent defects and
- Unrecorded process waste.

The Delphi Method was also used to identify the most effective methods of reducing the financial impact of error in the construction industry.

The results of the analysis using the Delphi Method are summarised below. The changes in the results between the first and second round of the Delphi Method analysis were small.
<h2>5.2.1. Ranking of the areas of work according to the financial impact of error</h2>
The analysis using the Grounded Theory Method provided us with a list of the areas of work in which errors occur with greatest frequency, as reported by our study group. The ranking does not necessarily reflect the economic significance, as some errors whilst frequent may have low cost impact. There was some overlap between the categories with resulted from the Grounded Theory Method.

For the Delphi Method analysis we required a concise list of the areas of work. The table below summaries the consolidation of the categories and the amended category titles which were adopted for the Delphi Method analysis.
Results of the analysis using the Grounded Theory Method Categories taken forward for analysis using the Delphi Method to identify the areas of work in which error has the most significant financial impact.
Areas of work in which errors occur with greatest frequency, as reported by our study group.

Notes:
A. The purpose of the analysis using the Delphi Method was to identify the areas of work in which error has the most significant financial impact. Although reported to have a high frequency, timber errors
were also reported have a low financial impact. To allow the experts to focus on the key issues this category was therefore omitted from the analysis using the Delphi Method.
B. The purpose of the analysis using the Delphi Method was to identify the areas of work in which error has the most significant financial impact. Following the structured interviews it was understood that
these areas of work in which errors occur at lower frequency were not the areas of work in which the financial impact of error was most significant. To allow the experts to focus on the key issues these
categories were therefore omitted from the analysis using the Delphi Method.
C. Although reported to be areas in which there is a lower frequency of occurrence ""Basement Waterproofing"" and ""Underground Waterproofing"" were reported to be areas of work in which the
financial impact of error is significant. Therefore these categories were combined and included in the analysis using the Delphi Method.

The first question of the Delphi Method analysis required each expert to rank the areas of work according to the financial impact of error in each area. The results of the analysis using the Delphi Method are
summarised below. The changes in the results between the first and second round of the Delphi Method analysis were small.
<h2>5.2.2. Ranking of the root causes of error according to financial impact</h2>
The analysis using the Grounded Theory Method provided us with a list of the root causes of error that were reported within our study group. The ranking is by frequency of reporting and does not necessarily reflect the economic significance as some of the root causes whilst frequent may have low cost impact. There was some overlap between the categories which resulted from the Grounded Theory Method, and the review of the results indicated that some of the categories would be better separated into a number of sub-categories.
For the Delphi Method analysis we required a concise list of the root causes of error. The table below summaries the adjusted categories and the amended category titles which were adopted for the Delphi
Method analysis.
<h2>5.2.3. The relative financial cost of error</h2>
In the third question of the Delphi Method analysis the experts were asked to assess the relative financial impact of: the direct costs of error, the indirect costs of error, latent defects and unrecorded process waste.
The estimated distribution of the costs was similar for the Civil Engineering and Building sectors. The results are summarised in the table and chart below.

&nbsp;
<h2>5.3. Online survey results</h2>
There were 143 responses to the online survey. However not everyone that started the survey answered all parts of each of the two detailed questions, the number of responses to each part varied from 59 to 73 of the total 143 participants.
The majority of respondents were trade contractors.

&nbsp;
<h2>5.3.1. Ranking of the areas of work according to the financial impact of error</h2>
The online survey respondents were asked the same question that the experts were asked during the Delphi Method Analysis. The respondents were asked to rank the areas of work according to the financial impact of error in each area. The results of the online survey are summarised below.
<h2>5.3.2. Ranking of the root causes of error according to financial impact</h2>
The online survey respondents were asked the same question that the experts were asked during the Delphi Method Analysis. The respondents were asked to assign an importance of each of the root causes
on a scale of 1 to 10. The results of the on line survey are summarised below.

<h2>5.5. Literature Review</h2>
The literature review is presented in Appendix B. The key findings are summarised below.
<h2>5.5.1. Errors</h2>
While many organisations maintain rework tracking systems, there is significant variation in the systems used.

There are many ways of describing construction error and the consequences of error. One system used by Reason (1995) usefully categorised errors as:

Failures of intention where the design or implementation plan is inadequate.

Failures of execution where actions do not go as planned.

Deliberate violations where the works deliberately deviate from the plan.

The desk research demonstrates that when we look for the causes of an error, it is useful to understand not only the physical root cause but also the systemic and behavioural context, why the problem by-passed opportunities for that problem to be captured, before becoming manifest as an error requiring rework.
<h2>5.5.2. Costs</h2>
Several recent studies have provided support for the use of 5% as an average approximation of the cost of rework in construction. For example, a study in 2009 of 177 construction projects found that the average owner reported rework cost was 5% across all projects. Further, research by the USA’s Construction Industry Institute (CII) reveals that direct costs caused by rework average 5% of total construction costs (CII 2005) (but range from 0-25%). This correlates well with the information that we have received from the steering group. However, these figures relate only to the cost of errors and defects which are recorded. From our research it is apparent that there is a significant further cost of rework which is completed before cost information is captured. The figures relate to the direct cost of errors. From our research it is apparent that there is a significant further indirect cost of errors defects. The implication of this is that the UK construction industry spends substantially more than £5bn per annum in rectifying errors and defects.

5.5.3. Root Causes

The literature identifies the following principal root causes of error:

Client changes.

Design errors by both the client’s design team and the contractor’s design team.

Failures in planning the execution of site works.

Time pressures.

Cost pressures.

The fragmentation of the industry.
<h2>5.5.4. Conclusions</h2>
Reducing client changes, improving design, and improving project planning are typically identified as the means by which the cost of reworking can be most effectively reduced. The Construction Industry Institute (CII) has presented what appears to be a useful Field Rework Index, a simple 14 question survey that is reported to provide a reasonable indication of the risk of rework on a project.
<h2></h2>"
Observations and Conclusions,"<h2>6.1. Scarcity of quantitative data</h2>
There is significant variation in whether and how companies record the cost of error. Few of the organisations that we interviewed had detailed quantitative data relating to errors. Where information was available the financial details generally related solely to the direct cost of error to the organisation being interviewed, rarely was information available on the cost (direct or indirect) to other parties. All of the systems that we saw only capture the direct cost of error, and do that only partially. The desk study indicates that this is common across the construction industry. Generally research has been completed on particular projects or sectors to inform the works referenced in the desk study.
<h2>6.2. Review of the analysis using the Grounded Theory Method</h2>
The research team had good access to a broad spectrum of highly experienced individuals who worked for leading companies in the UK construction industry. Despite this the sample size necessarily represented a very small part of the UK construction industry. However, there were strong common themes that arose from the interviews and these themes are compatible with the results of the studies referenced in the literature review. We believe that it is reasonable to consider that the structured interviews successfully identified the most significant root causes of error in the UK construction industry, as well as the areas of work in which error occurs with the greatest frequency.
The majority of the people interviewed worked for Tier 1 Contractors. This selection was intentional since it was believed that Tier 1 Contractors would have an overview of the construction industry and that these individuals would therefore have a balanced understanding of the occurrence of error across the industry. As would be expected in different sectors of the industry, different areas of work have the highest frequency of error. However, the root causes of error were found to be similar across the civil engineering and building sectors.
The strongest themes arising from the structured interviews were that the principal causes of error included:
Poor planning, and in particular a failure to adequately rework the plan when things do not go to
plan.
Poor design (both by client side design teams and by designers working for trade contractors).
A desire to “Do something”.
Errors by the trades are rarely the result of a lack of technical ability. These errors are frequently a result of a lack of adequate planning by the individual of the particular task.
All of these items represent a failure to think in advance. A similarly strong theme was that errors are often the result of a failure of communication of all types (written, drawn and verbal) and at all levels.
<h2>6.3. Review of the analysis using the Delphi Method</h2>
The experts were very experienced individuals who work across a broad range of the UK construction industry. The majority of the people interviewed worked for Tier 1 Contractors. This selection was intentional since it was believed that Tier 1 Contractors would have an overview of the construction industry and that these individuals would therefore have a balanced understanding of the occurrence of error across the industry. There was little change in the results of the first and second round of the Delphi Method analysis. It is very unlikely that the results would have altered materially if further rounds of the analysis had been completed.
The differences in the rankings assigned by the experts from the Civil Engineering and Building sectors reflect the nature of the work in each sector.
<h2>6.4. Review of the online survey</h2>
The invitation to complete the online survey was circulated to professionals working in the UK Construction Industry, however we have limited information about the people who responded and the respondents may not be representative of the whole of the UK construction industry. For example it is possible to conceive of scenarios in which enthusiasm within one or two organisations would lead to skewed results. Therefore the survey results should not be considered definitive.

Of the 143 respondents around 70 answered each part of each of the two questions. There is a good balance between the building and civil engineering sectors.

The majority (63%) of the respondents to the online survey identified themselves as trade contractors.

To encourage participation the online survey was designed to be something that could be completed within a few minutes. The majority of the respondents to the online survey had probably not considered the occurrence of error in the construction industry in the same depth as the people we met during the structured interviews and the experts who participated in the Delphi Method analysis.

There was a small number of respondents who do not appear to have given the questions due consideration
– for example all of the root causes of error have been assigned the same maximum weighting. However the majority of the respondents to the online survey do appear to have provided considered answers.
The principal themes that emerge from the comments are that planning and design need to improve and that one of the principal barriers to this is the late appointment of trade contractors.
<h2>6.5. Review of the comparison of the results of the Delphi Method and the online survey</h2>
Most significant areas by financial impact arising from errors

<em>Civil engineering</em>
The principal differences in the rankings assigned by the Delphi Method and the online survey are:
1. Mechanical systems (including BMS) were ranked as the 3rd most significant item by the Delphi Method analysis and as the 9th most significant item by the online survey. The discrepancy may
indicate that the civil engineering experts in the Delphi Method analysis were influenced by the discussion of the impact of Mechanical systems (including BMS) in the building sector.
2. Piling work is ranked more highly in the online survey (3rd most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (8th most significant area of work).
3. Damage to completed works is ranked more highly in the online survey (6th most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (11th most significant area of work).
The differences in the rankings may be a result of the larger proportion of trade contractors in the online survey responses than there was among the Delphi Method experts.

The online survey results are broadly consistent with the other results of the Delphi Method analysis.

<em>Building</em>
The principal differences in the rankings assigned by the Delphi Method and the online survey are:
1. Mechanical systems (including BMS) were ranked as the most significant item by the Delphi Method analysis and as the 5th most significant item by the online survey.
2. Basement waterproofing is ranked more highly in the online survey (3rd most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (7th most significant area of work).

The online survey results are broadly consistent with the other results of the Delphi Method analysis.
<em>Across industry</em>
There are substantial differences between the online survey rankings and the results of the Delphi Method analysis. However the apparently large discrepancies between the rankings are the result of
small differences in the averages of the rankings assigned by the respondents: the apparently large discrepancies are a reflection of the fact that once the results of the Civil Engineering and Building
sectors are combined there is little difference in the average rankings for the work areas between “Damage to completed elements” and “Electrical Systems”.
Therefore despite the apparent large discrepancies, the online survey results are in fact broadly consistent with the other results of the Delphi Method analysis.
<h2>Ranking of the root causes of error according to financial impact</h2>
<em>Civil engineering</em>
The principal differences in the rankings assigned by the Delphi Method and the online survey are:
1. Poor culture in relation to quality is ranked as the 3rd most significant item by the Delphi Method analysis and as the 10th most significant item by the online survey. The discrepancy is a result in
small differences in the average weightings applied to several items.
2. Excessive commercial (financial and time) pressures is ranked as the 4th most significant item by the Delphi Method analysis and as the 10th most significant item by the online survey. The
discrepancy is a result in small differences in the average weightings applied to several items.
3. Inadequate attention paid in the design to construction is ranked more highly in the online survey (the most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (11th most significant
area of work). The discrepancy is a result in small differences in the average weightings applied to several items in the online survey.
4. Deficient materials or components is ranked more highly in the online survey (7th most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (12th most significant area of work). The
discrepancy is a result in small differences in the average weightings applied to several items in the online survey.
The Delphi Method ranking of the remaining areas of work is broadly confirmed by the online survey results.
<em>Building</em>
The principal differences in the rankings assigned by the Delphi Method and the online survey are:
1. Poor culture in relation to quality is ranked as the 5th most significant item by the Delphi Method analysis and as the 11th most significant item by the online survey.
2. Late design changes are ranked more highly in the online survey (3rd most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (9th most significant area of work).
The Delphi Method ranking of the remaining areas of work is broadly confirmed by the online survey results.
<em>Across industry</em>
The principal differences in the rankings assigned by the Delphi Method and the online survey are:
1. Poor culture in relation to quality is ranked as the 3rd most significant item in the Delphi Method analysis and as the 10th most significant item by the online survey. The discrepancy is a result in
small differences in the average weightings applied to several items in the online survey.
2. Inadequate attention paid in the design to construction is ranked more highly the online survey (the most significant item) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (the 6th most significant item).
The discrepancy is a result in small differences in the average weightings applied to several items in the online survey.
3. Ineffective communication between team members is ranked more highly in the online survey (5th most significant item) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (9th most significant item). The
discrepancy is a result in small differences in the average weightings applied to several items in the online survey.
4. Inadequate trade skills is ranked more highly in the online survey (5th most significant area of work) than it was by the Delphi Method analysis (9th most significant area of work). The discrepancy
is a result in small differences in the average weightings applied to several items in the online survey.

The Delphi Method ranking of the remaining areas of work is broadly confirmed by the online survey
results.
Viewed as a whole the online line survey corroborates the result of the Delphi Method analysis.
<h2>6.6. An estimate of the total cost of error in the UK construction industry</h2>
Recent studies referred to in the desk study suggest that the direct cost of recorded error is around 5% of the total construction cost. This figure is consistent with the figures reported to us by Tier 1 Contractors. Our research suggests that the direct cost of error to Tier 2 Contractors and below may well be greater than 5%. The Delphi Method analysis provided us with an estimate of the relative magnitude of costs arising from recorded direct costs (24%), indirect costs (34%), unrecorded process waste (29%) and latent defects (13%). If we assume that the direct cost of recorded error is around 5% the results of the Delphi analysis suggest the total cost of error to the UK construction industry is around 21% of the total spend.

This figure suggests that there has been some improvement since the Egan report in 1998 which quoted a figure of 30% for the cost of rework in the USA, Scandinavia and the UK. The Delphi Method
estimate of the total cost of error as around 21% of the total spend is also consistent with the work by Barber et al. (2000) who suggested that rework might be as high as 23% of contract value.

Love &amp; Edwards (2004) showed that earlier work on rework costs reported values of between 3 and 15 per cent of an individual project’s contract value; while in 2015 Simpeh et al. (2015) found that the total rework costs range from 0% to 75%.
In summary: improvements have been made in the seventeen years since the Egan report, however scope remains to make substantial further reductions in the cost of error.
<h2>6.7. Where the cost of error is carried</h2>
Following this phase of the Get It Right Initiative we believe that majority of the initial cost of error is incurred by Tier 2 Contractors and this cost is often invisible both to Tier 1 Contractors and to end Clients. While the initial costs are incurred by Tier 2 Contractors, that cost is included in procurement costs: although the cost of error is often invisible to Clients the cost is passed on to Clients.
Most companies recognise that there is a cost issue with errors but it appears that none is clear as to the full extent of those costs. The structure of the supply chain and the business models of those involved make it difficult for any single organisation to develop a comprehensive understanding of the costs of error in the construction process.

Across the industry

6.8. The areas of work in which the financial impact of error is most significant

The areas of work where the financial impact of error is the most significant are:
Concrete
Mechanical and Electrical
Facades
However, there is potential to reduce the cost of error across the industry particularly if we concentrate on the root causes as discussed below.
<h2>6.9. The financially most significant root causes of error</h2>
The main reasons for error lie in the areas of poor planning, changes, poor communication and incorrect design at all levels. All of these can be summarised as action commencing before there is sufficient
understanding of the requirements.
This failure is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in the “Get It Done” attitude that is commonplace and admired in our industry and which means that poor decisions are frequently made.
Effective communication delivers understanding and involves relationships as much as clarity of expression in drawings, documents and words. Ineffective working relationships are a significant contributing factor to failures of communication and the errors that result.
Achieving an understanding of the requirements takes time. Rushed procurement, rushed design and rushed planning all compromise effective understanding and contribute to the occurrence of error.
Some events are outside the control of the project team: there are deviations from even the best laid plans. A plan must be resilient, and it must be maintained. There is abundant evidence from this phase of the Get It Right Initiative that as an industry we fall short on this.
There are many specialisms in the industry with the consequence that many people work in silos. This causes errors in implementation. As an example designers need to understand the consequences to the
procurement process of what they are designing whilst those carrying out the procurement need to understand the importance of not deviating from a specification.
Current design, procurement and construction processes sometimes generate perverse outcomes (e.g. ignoring an error in the design documentation knowing that there will be scope to make a claim later)
<h2>6.10. Towards a reduction in the cost of error in the UK construction industry</h2>
Reduction of error presents a major opportunity for achieving a reduction of cost to the UK construction industry.
The majority of the initial cost of error is incurred by Tier 2 Contractors. The Tier 1 Contractors can take steps to reduce the cost of error to Tier 2 Contractors. The improvements that can be achieved by the Tier 2 Contractors will be limited without the active assistance of Tier 1 contractors. It appears that there is sometimes little incentive for the Tier 1 Contractors to act to reduce the cost of error to the Tier 2
Contractors.
Although there are arguments which say that different forms of contract engender better or worse approaches to the elimination of error we found little evidence that the form of contract is a key cause of
error. Perhaps the key contribution would be a contract that delivers effective working relationships between individuals. More important than the form of contract is that organisations must have the right culture to encourage the  elimination of error. Currently we put an over-reliance on contractual communications and formal communications. We need to focus on forming effective relationships both at an individual and organisational  level. Time is a crucial factor and the dominance of the programme has a negative impact on quality. The industry has a reputation for getting on with things to the detriment of thinking things through to make sure that we have the right solutions. The Get It Done attitude that is commonplace and admired in our industry means that poor decisions are frequently made. At all levels people need to be educated so that they stand back and think before taking action. Change always creates the risk of error. It is important for organisations to try to minimise change once the
process has started. However, even if we control the controllable we will still have to deal with events and circumstances over which we have no control. As an industry we need to get closer to the military model where it is recognised that things will not go according to plan and to replan accordingly. This is a crucial area of eliminating error. We need to control the controllable and replan the uncontrolled.
It is difficult for a single organisation to make sustained progress in reducing errors within their own work because the root causes often sit outside their direct control.
There has been criticism of the Construction Industry suggesting that if it followed automotive industry practices it would be much more efficient and that there would be less error. Construction is different to production industries such as the automotive industry. This does not mean that we should not adopt techniques from the automotive industry but we do need to recognise that the industries are very different.
In terms of looking ahead we need to change our focus from managing the consequences of error to eliminating the causes of error. Despite many of the issues of poor practice that we have highlighted it must be said that there are some outstanding examples of good practice. There are organisations where the approach to eliminating error is lead from the top of the organisation. There is no doubt that the level of quality achieved by these organisations is several orders of magnitude higher than the others. The challenge is to bring all of the less well performing organisations up to the same level.

Appendix A - On Line Survey,This appendix includes additional information relating to the online survey. The appendix includes: 1. The survey questions that respondents were asked to complete. 2. The results of the online survey presented to identify the differences in the responses provided by Main Contractors and Trade Contractors in each of the building and civil engineering sectors.
The Survey Questions,"It is estimated that each year the construction industry wastes between 3% and 10% of its circa £100 billon turnover in correcting errors and possibly more.

To meet this challenge the Get It Right Initiative Group is carrying out a research project into errors in construction and their causes. The objective of the study is to identify the root causes of errors and develop initiatives to save costs by eliminating errors at all levels of the construction process.

The output of the report will be disseminated throughout the industry so that the lessons learned can be adopted by all as appropriate. The group is made up of a significant number of Clients, Main Contractors and specialist contractors and the study is funded jointly by these Companies and the CITB.

Survey created by the Get It Right Initiative Group."
The Results for Main Contractors and Trade Contractors,"The charts below plot the survey results split by the responses from the main contractors and trade contractors. Relatively small numbers of clients and designers responded to the survey, therefore the results for clients and designers have not been presented separately. Note that the results from clients and designers are included in the category “Overall”."
Tools to Reduce Error,"To improve the construction process, more attention should be paid to project planning and design … ‘it’s not rocket science’.

BIM is expected to help encourage an early focus on coordination and planning. The successful implementation of quality enhancement programmes is heavily dependent on communication and teamwork within and between organisations in the construction supply chain.

Quality enhancement techniques, developed in the manufacturing industries, provide examples of how process manufacturing organisations – such as house builders – might go about reducing their rates of rework. However, the bespoke nature of much of the non-residential building stock means that the approaches to improving quality within individual organisations has limited applicability to a fragmented supply chain."
Summary,"The previous sections have highlighted the impacts and causes of error and rework in the construction industry and introduced methods which can be or are used to identify, monitor and manage rework. The quality programmes identified are generally based on the model of Plan – Do – Check – Act. These seek to reduce the likelihood of errors arising in the first instance and catching them early should they do so. The literature points towards the importance of a quality environment, led by the client and implemented by the tier one contractor.

Further, the importance of allowing sufficient time for design development and reflection on decisions is highlighted. The development of a quality environment may require a shift in industry thinking about quality.

To aid this shift, we turn to Philip Crosby, “The Fun Uncle of the Quality Revolution“. Crosby is of the view that “[t]o create a manufacturing process that has zero defects management must set the tone"
Appendix,"This appendix provides some more background to quality management methodologies used across industries and introduces some of the UK industry initiatives to help reduce error and rework in construction industry. A.1.1 – Methodological approaches to quality management Plan – Do – Check – Act (or adjust)

At its most fundamental, the quality enhancement process can be described as an iterative four stage process, sometimes known as the Deming cycle. The four stages: Plan; Do; Check; Adjust (or Act) – PDCA – are necessary for continuous improvement in many of the following methodologies.

Each methodology represents an implementation of the PDCA approach, but will focus on either the whole or part of the process. Further, the levels of sophistication of implementation may vary, some approaches use statistical approaches to understand deviations, others may require more subjective"
