Spreadsheets with Site Content
==============================

Spreadsheets are named by the singular form of the post-type, so "resources" content is in resource.csv.

Click "Open with Google Sheets" to open the spreadsheet as a Google sheet - you can then download in the format you require:

Click "File" > "Download as" > Make selection
